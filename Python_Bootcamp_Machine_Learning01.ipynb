        "\n",
        "The main feature of unsupervised learning algorithms, when compared to classification and regression methods, is that input data are unlabeled (i.e. no labels or classes given) and that the algorithm learns the structure of the data without any assistance. This creates two main differences. First, it allows us to process large amounts of data because the data does not need to be manually labeled. Second, it is difficult to evaluate the quality of an unsupervised algorithm due to the absence of an explicit goodness metric as used in supervised learning.  \n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most common tasks in unsupervised learning is dimensionality reduction. On one hand, dimensionality reduction may help with data visualization (e.g. t-SNE method) while, on the other hand, it may help deal with the multicollinearity of your data and prepare the data for a supervised learning method (e.g. decision trees).\n",

        "\n",
        "Principal Component Analysis is one of the easiest, most intuitive, and most frequently used methods for dimensionality reduction, projecting data onto its orthogonal feature subspace.\n",

        "More generally speaking, all observations can be considered as an ellipsoid in a subspace of an initial feature space, and the new basis set in this subspace is aligned with the ellipsoid axes. This assumption lets us remove highly correlated features since basis set vectors are orthogonal. \n",
        "In the general case, the resulting ellipsoid dimensionality matches the initial space dimensionality, but the assumption that our data lies in a subspace with a smaller dimension allows us to cut off the \"excessive\" space with the new projection (subspace). We accomplish this in a 'greedy' fashion, sequentially selecting each of the ellipsoid axes by identifying where the dispersion is maximal.\n",

        "> \"To deal with hyper-planes in a 14 dimensional space, visualize a 3D space and say 'fourteen' very loudly. Everyone does it.\" - Geoffrey Hinton\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's take a look at the mathematical formulation of this process:\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to decrease the dimensionality of our data from $n$ to $k$ with $k \\leq n$, we sort our list of axes in order of decreasing dispersion and take the top-$k$ of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "We begin by computing the dispersion and the covariance of the initial features. This is usually done with the covariance matrix. According to the covariance definition, the covariance of two features is computed as follows: $$cov(X_i, X_j) = E[(X_i - \\mu_i) (X_j - \\mu_j)] = E[X_i X_j] - \\mu_i \\mu_j,$$ where $\\mu_i$ is the expected value of the $i$th feature. It is worth noting that the covariance is symmetric, and the covariance of a vector with itself is equal to its dispersion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore the covariance matrix is symmetric with the dispersion of the corresponding features on the diagonal. Non-diagonal values are the covariances of the corresponding pair of features. In terms of matrices where $\\mathbf{X}$ is the matrix of observations, the covariance matrix is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\Sigma = E[(\\mathbf{X} - E[\\mathbf{X}]) (\\mathbf{X} - E[\\mathbf{X}])^{T}]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Quick recap: matrices, as linear operators, have eigenvalues and eigenvectors. They are very convenient because they describe parts of our space that do not rotate and only stretch when we apply linear operators on them; eigenvectors remain in the same direction but are stretched by a corresponding eigenvalue. Formally, a matrix $M$ with eigenvector $w_i$ and eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ satisfy this equation: $M w_i = \\lambda_i w_i$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The covariance matrix for a sample $\\mathbf{X}$ can be written as a product of $\\mathbf{X}^{T} \\mathbf{X}$. According to the [Rayleigh quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_quotient), the maximum variation of our sample lies along the eigenvector of this matrix and is consistent with the maximum eigenvalue. Therefore, the principal components we aim to retain from the data are just the eigenvectors corresponding to the top-$k$ largest eigenvalues of the matrix.\n",
        "\n",
        "The next steps are easier to digest. We multiply the matrix of our data $X$ by these components to get the projection of our data onto the orthogonal basis of the chosen components. If the number of components was smaller than the initial space dimensionality, remember that we will lose some information upon applying this transformation."
